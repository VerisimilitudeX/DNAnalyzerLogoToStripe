# DNAnalyzerLogoToStripe

This repository uses the [DNAnalyzer](https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/DNAnalyzer) logo as a demonstration of how to use [logo2cc](https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/logo2cc), a custom Python library used to convert corporate logos into Stripe credit card-compatible image files.
